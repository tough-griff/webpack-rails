# Webpack::Rails

Easily implement webpack into your Rails (4.0+) project!

Based on my working implementation
[here](https://github.com/tough-griff/rails-webpack-demo)

## Installation
Simply add `webpack-rails` to your `Gemfile`:
```ruby
gem "webpack-rails"
```
install:
```
bundle install
```
and run the rails installation generator:
```
rails generate webpack:install
```
> The installation script will generate a `webpack-rails` initializer, a
> `frontend` directory for your JS/CSS/SCSS assets, and webpack configuration
> files.

## Usage
